# jakenpo-python-flask

This is a simple Jankenpo game in Python with the Flask framework


# Code

The code is simple. The logic is in the file `index.py`. It renders a HTML code (`index.html` who uses some assets that are in the `assets` folder).

`index.py` have two methods related to requests. One, `index()`, only renders a template that allows the user to select his option and send to the `process` method through `POST` method . The other, `process`, process the request with user option, select an computer random option, compares the this options and sends to the post request:
- The computer option;
- The winner;

(The page already know the user option)
